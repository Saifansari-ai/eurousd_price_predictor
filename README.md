### Data Usage

The dataset is used to train and test machine learning models aimed at predicting future EUR/USD prices. The models analyze patterns and trends within the historical data to forecast future movements in the exchange rate.

### Data Preprocessing

Before using the data for model training, several preprocessing steps are performed:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing missing or erroneous data points to ensure the quality of the dataset.
- **Normalization**: Scaling the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the distance calculations in machine learning algorithms.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that may enhance the predictive power of the models.

### Conclusion

Understanding the dataset is crucial for building effective predictive models. By leveraging historical data and carefully preprocessing it, the project aims to provide accurate predictions of the EUR/USD exchange rate, which can be beneficial for traders, investors, and financial analysts.
